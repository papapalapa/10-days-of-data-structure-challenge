# Day 2 : Data Structure

## Heap (Priority Queue)
### Min Heap
Elements are all smaller than their children.

The root node will be the smallest element, but the elements get bigger as you move down the level.

### Max Heap
Elements are all larger than their children

The root node will be the largest element, but the elements get smaller as you move down the level.

### Insertion
It always goes in the next empty spot looking top to bottom and left to right.

If the element for insertion is not in the right position, conduct [bubble sort](https://github.com/papapalapa/BoomAlgo/blob/master/Bubble_Sort.ipynb) (or swap).
