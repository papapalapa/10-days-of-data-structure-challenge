# Day 4 : Data Structure
## Stacks
* Linear data structure
* Flexible size
* LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)

When dealing with stacks, simply imagine a deck of cards. When you want to remove a card from the deck, you start with the card on top. Also, if you want to add a card to the deck, you add a card on the top of the deck.

### Insertion
Add an item to the top

### Deletion
Remove the top item

## Queues
* Linear data structure
* Flexible size
* FIFO (First-In-First-Out)

When dealing with queues, imagine a line of people waiting for a tech conference. When a new person is added to the queue, that person (aka the **tail**) will stand at the end of the line. Accordingly, the first person standing in the line (aka the **head**) will get to enjoy the conference first.

### Insertion
Add an item to the tail

### Deletion
Remove the head
